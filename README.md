# CoviCare

The inspiration for this project came from the second wave of covid 19. There is an extreme shortage of oxygen , beds ,
in hospitals and even medicines. There were no one place where people can go to check if oxygen or beds are availabe or not.
Patients had to go from one hospital to another and from one oxygen supplier to another and even though didn't get any lead.
Also the people who had oxygen cylinders or other supplies were not able to effectively sell them to the needy ones as they didn't know where to post that they have surplus supplies. As we lack a particular platform people started posting stuffs on different social media such as whatsapp, twitter, linkedin etc.
 So there was a need of a central authority that would integrate these things together.
An app that could act as a platform for solving this problem, where hospitals can connect directly with patients and inform them about the availability of beds,oxygen suppliers.
One stop solution for the all patients to get all the neccessary medicines , oxygen and beds so that they dont go from place to place only to get rejected. Our app is an effort to provide a complete 
solution for all covid needs..
